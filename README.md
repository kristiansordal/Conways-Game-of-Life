## What is Game of Life?

The Game of Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is what is commonly referred to as a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.

## How do I play?

Simply run the script, and watch the evolution unfold

### What about controls?

No controls are really needed, however you will be prompted with the following information when you run the script

- Press 'S' to play
- Press 'P' to pause

In addition, changing the **cellSize** and **FPS** variable in the code allows you to set the speed of the evolution, as well as the size of the cells.
